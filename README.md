# United States Military Academy Development Updates
In our dynamic development environment, updates are systematically organized within a comprehensive package housed in a centralized development repository. This package serves as the nexus for disseminating changes across all the games actively utilized by USAR. The configuration of these files is meticulously designed to facilitate seamless deployment, ensuring that certain features may be selectively disabled or enabled based on the specific requirements of each game.

These detailed logs meticulously chronicle every modification, providing a transparent record of alterations, the date of implementation, and accompanying patch notes or hotfixes. This streamlined approach enables us to efficiently propagate a singular, unified code base across multiple games concurrently, fostering consistency and ease of management within our expansive gaming ecosystem.
